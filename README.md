# Capstone-Project-Step-1

1. Full Bakery E-Commerce Website 🥐🍰🧁
   * This could be a complete online store for a bakery to sell items like cakes, pastries and more.
   * It will include product information (name, description, price, and images), user accounts, and order details.

2. Build Your Own Donut Shop 🍩
   * This could be fun to let people visually build a donut such as (glaze, filling, toppings) then they can save their donut and order it.
   * This will include available donut bases, toppings, fillings, and glazes, along with user accounts and custom orders.
  
3. Custom Drink Builder Website 🧋☕️🫖
   * We can build it using boba tea, coffee, milkshakes, smoothies or any other drinks then people can pick ingredients, preview the drink, and place an order.
   * This will include a list of available ingredients, people's preferences, and custom drink orders, all of which will be stored in a database.

The first one could potentially be the one I would most likely work on but Im not 100% sure as of right now
